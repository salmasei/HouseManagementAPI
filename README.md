House Management API

This repository provides a well-structured and progressively enhanced House Management API. It offers various branches catering to different needs:

Branches:

master (Recommended): This branch represents the final, optimized version of the API. It incorporates code cleaning, rate limiting, and other improvements, along with a clean separation of concerns using the CQRS pattern.
basic (Starting Point): This branch serves as the foundation, containing essential API methods for managing house-related operations.
asynced-cache (Asynchronous Enhancements): This branch builds upon the basic functionality, transforming all methods to asynchronous operations for improved performance. It also introduces a caching mechanism to optimize data retrieval.
cqrs-clean-code (Advanced Architecture): This branch implements a clean architecture with separate command and query handlers, adhering to the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern. Additionally, it includes notification and logging capabilities.
